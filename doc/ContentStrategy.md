# EchoPal Content Strategy

## Purpose
To empower users to become more confident, effective communicators by delivering real-time, actionable feedback and supportive learning content—always with empathy, privacy, and growth in mind.

---

## Core Principles
- **Empathy-Driven:** All content (tips, reports, prompts) should be encouraging, never judgmental.
- **Actionable:** Feedback must be specific and immediately useful (e.g., "Try pausing before responding to reduce filler words").
- **Personalized:** Content adapts to each user's scenario, goals, and progress.
- **Privacy-First:** Avoid sharing or storing sensitive data unless explicitly opted in.
- **Mobile-Optimized:** Content is concise, scannable, and designed for on-the-go consumption.

## Content Types
- **Real-Time Feedback:**
  - On-screen tips and gentle nudges during conversations.
  - Short, positive, and actionable (e.g., "Ask an open-ended question now!").
- **Post-Conversation Reports:**
  - Visual summaries (charts, scores) and plain-language analysis.
  - Suggestions for improvement and highlights of progress.
- **Scenario-Based Practice:**
  - Contextual prompts and role-play scripts for interviews, dates, negotiations, etc.
  - Adaptive difficulty and targeted advice.
- **Educational Micro-Content:**
  - Bite-sized communication tips, confidence boosters, and best practices.
- **Notifications/Reminders:**
  - Motivational nudges and progress reminders, always respectful and opt-in.
