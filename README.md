# EchoPal

**AI-Powered Real-Time Conversation Coach**

EchoPal is a next-generation mobile app that helps you become a better communicator—whether in social, professional, or practice scenarios. Using state-of-the-art AI, EchoPal listens, analyzes, and coaches you in real time, providing actionable feedback and personalized post-conversation reports.

## Key Features

### Live Speech Analysis
- Real-time transcription using speech-to-text APIs (OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text).
- AI (GPT-4 or Gemini) analyzes your tone, clarity, and filler words (like "um," "like").
- Subtle nudges via earbud vibrations or on-screen tips to help you improve as you speak.

### Context-Aware Suggestions
- **Social Anxiety:** Gentle prompts to ask open-ended questions or remember key details (e.g., "They mentioned their dog—ask about its name!").
- **Professional Settings:** Tips for sounding confident, concise, and diplomatic.

### Post-Convo Breakdown
- Generates a report with metrics: talking speed, interruptions, positivity score, and highlights key moments.
- Personalized suggestions (e.g., "You dominated 80% of the chat—try active listening next time!").

### Customizable Scenarios
- Practice modes for job interviews, first dates, or tough negotiations with AI-generated personas.

### Privacy Assured
- On-device processing where possible.
- Opt-in cloud sync for long-term progress tracking.

### Monetization
- **Freemium:** Free for basic analysis, premium for advanced metrics and custom scenarios.
- **B2B:** Corporate training version for professional communication teams.

## Tech Stack
- **AI APIs:** OpenAI Whisper (speech), GPT-4 (context analysis), Google Gemini (alternative).
- **Mobile:** Native Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) for low-latency audio processing.

## Why EchoPal Stands Out
Unlike static writing tools, EchoPal augments your real-world conversations in the moment, blending AI with actionable, real-time feedback to help you grow as a communicator.
